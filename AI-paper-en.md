## **14. Partnership:**

Since AI is an innovative technology in the field of information technology, it requires coordination and partnership with various stakeholders. Particularly, as AI usage needs to be regulated and made effective through proper governance, partnerships are crucial. Stakeholders will include government, telecommunication and information technology service providers, the community, and commercial, research, and academic institutions.

## **15. Scope of Study:**

Artificial Intelligence is an emerging technology, and its use is currently limited to a few sectors. There is limited availability of experts in these sectors. There has not been extensive interaction with international experts and civil society for broader understanding. However, this report has been prepared through detailed analysis of available reports and documents, including suggestions from commercial, private sectors, and university experts, as well as desk studies of international experiences. Additional suggestions collected from the ministry's website and other various means can be incorporated into this report for implementation.

## **16. Conclusion:**

Global attention is increasingly focused on the use, research, and development of Artificial Intelligence. Appropriate initiatives need to be taken from each sector regarding the development, use, and regulation of AI. Firstly, the government needs to establish comprehensive policies, laws, and procedures related to Artificial Intelligence. This includes creating national policies on AI, forming national strategies, legal frameworks for data protection, standards related to the privacy and security of AI use and users, and aligning national data protection and privacy laws with international standards. Secondly, a governance structure related to Artificial Intelligence should be established to encourage and monitor AI developers and designers to adhere to existing national and international standards. An inclusive and dedicated body should be established to oversee the use, promotion, and regulation of AI. Additionally, self-regulation should be promoted to encourage effective and safe AI use. Thirdly, research and utilization of AI should be prioritized and enhanced. Investments and initiatives should be directed towards promoting privacy protection, transparency, accountability, and the development and promotion of AI usage. Fourthly, programs to support AI use should be implemented, with each sector prioritizing the development and promotion of AI in their policies and programs. Lastly, the reskilling, upskilling, and training of the existing workforce should be prioritized. Availability of skilled human resources in the commercial and private sectors will drive the development, use, and promotion of AI, thus attention should be directed towards building human capital in this sector. This report, with further incorporation of suggestions collected from the ministry's website and other various means, will be suitable for implementation.
